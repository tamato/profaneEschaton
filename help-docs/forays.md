14.8 Forays

WHAT IS A FORAY?
----------------

A "foray" is the name given to a difficult task or challenge undertaken by a
group of Intrepid adventurers. Each foray takes place in a unique, isolated
setting, found among dozens of possible remote areas of the wilderness. The
trials you may face are varied, ranging from confusing puzzles that must be
solved to overwhelming denizens that must be defeated. One singular theme unites
the forays, however, and that is that none can be completed alone. These are no
ordinary hunting grounds, and the combined might of an Intrepid group will be
required if you hope to succeed and claim their rewards.

HOW CAN I UNDERTAKE A FORAY?
---------------------

To engage in a foray, you will need to be in a group and visit the foray board
in the common room of the Wander Inn, in New Thera. From there, you will be able
to review which forays are available (using READ BOARD), and see any additional
information on them (such as a minimum or maximum group size) with READ BOARD
<foray name/number>.

SIGN FOR THE <foray> FORAY is used to accept a foray from the board. This will
automatically add the foray to your entire group's repertoire.

WHERE CAN I FIND THE FORAY?
---------------------------

Once your group is assembled and you have accepted a challenge from the board,
you are ready to begin your foray! You will have an Achaean day (real hour)
after accepting your task to discover the foray's whereabouts.

Each foray has a number of possible locations where it can appear, all contained
within the wilderness. These invariably follow a distinct theme (such as
mountains or coasts) and most will have a hint either in the description or with
a specific clue (use the INTREPID command to view your current foray status).
Once you are ready, enter the wilderness and begin exploring!

FORAY REWARDS
-------------

As well as the experience and gold acquired from a successful foray, (not to
mention the prestige of being a victorious member of the Intrepid), each foray
has its own unique talisman that can be obtained. Some of these are rarer than
others, with the rarest of all opening a brand new, special foray location to be
faced down.

INSURANCE
---------

This may be purchased at the foray board by the group leader of an active
foray. The cost of this scales based on the foray and your group size.

BUY INSURANCE to purchase this! (Group leader only!)

If your group leader has paid the premium, you will be able to CALL FOR AID
instead of embracing death to be resurrected outside your foray after the death
sequence concludes.

Once purchased this can be used repeatedly, but only for the active foray.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
----------------------

In addition to the Achaean day time limit to discover a foray's location, each
foray has its own time limit for completion. This timer begins once inside, can
be seen using the INTREPID command, and has devastating consequences when it
expires. You should endeavour to complete these challenges promptly if you hope
to emerge victorious!

Forays are unique in that they are flexible to the levels of the group
undertaking them. As such, a group of three dragons facing down Aran'Kesh, the
Fleshrender (for example) will find a similar challenge to that faced by a group
of level 70 adventurers.

Teamwork cannot be emphasised enough. Many forays will require cooperation and
strategic thinking, rather than brute force, to overcome.
