Greetings, budding Occultist. You have probably been directed to this
scroll either because no other teacher is around, or they are simply
unavaiable and chose to give you something to study before they help
you. Whichever the case, this guide is meant as a comprehensive resource
to help you invest wisely, and ensuring no mistake is made onyour path
to Enlightenment*.

-----------------
--[ Equipment ]--
-----------------

For starters, you're gonna want to pick yourself up some scalemail
armour as well as a cavalry shield, with a fist sigil attached to the
latter. Following that you'll want to get a tarot deck, and a bunch of
blank cards which you can find at the Central Market. Ideally get either
as many as you can afford, or as many as they have. You'll be using a
lot of most of them at some point in your life.

(HELP TRAITS)
For an Occultist's traits, you'll generally want to have quick-witted as
your first. For your 'stat trait' your best choice is usually
Brilliance, but if you can manage 17 Intelligence without it, Robust can
be beneficial as well. Third is mostly up to you, but the two
commonly-chosen ones are normally Mind Warden or Sticky Stirrups.
Blissful Ignorance and Meticulous Care are the only recommended minors;
others are entirely personal preference.

Next up is an ideal plan for investing your lessons. This isn't a
mandated requirement, but for those who're unsure of how to spend their
lessons, it should help nudge you in the right direction. Keep in mind
this is assuming you're past the beginner steps of learning, so baby
steps won't be included.

 - Transcendent in Occultism, gives all your core abilities.
- Tarot at least until Justice gives you most offensive tarot cards to
use.
- Domination up until Cadmus at least, to get all the main primebonds
available.
 - Transcendent Avoidance at this point if you hunt as an Occultist.
 - Finish off both Tarot and Domination.
 - Transcendent Survival (automatically achieved at Logosian)
 - You're set.

Other options beyond this point are Riding and Vision (ideally to
mounttreading and contemplation respectively, before transing them).
Miniskills are a very nice thing to have once you start delving further
into combat.

------------------
--[ Primebonds ]--
------------------

A relatively new concept that is still being studied, the effects will
be listed below for brevity, with some helpful suggestions following for
those needing a little more advice.

Rixil - Drains mana. Shivering and frozen both drain more.
Eerion - Dizziness. Knocks off-bal if already dizzy.
Scrag - Bleeding. More if they have haemophilia.
Pyradius - Sets foes ablaze.
Palpatar - Periodic nausea.
Nin'kharsag - Damage. More damage if they have healthleech.
Nemesis - Damages health. Damages mana as well if they have addiction.
Buul - Random choice of undeaf/stun, prone or sleep.
Cadmus - Random mental afflictions. (masked to you, not to them)
Lycantha - Periodic shield strip.
Hecate - Random limb breaks (mending only)

Based on experimentation thus far, there are a few combinations you can
use for primebonds depending on what you're wanting to achieve.

For groups, the best is probably Nin'kharsag, Nemesis, Lycantha and
Buul. This gives you a nice increase to damage dealt, as well well as
some utility with the shield stripping/proning of the latter two. Rixil
can be another useful option if you have a Magi in the group. The mana
drain is certainly nothing to scoff at.

For solo there is some more flexibility based on what you're wanting to
do. For general purpose, Palpatar is the only one that is highly
recommended due to the additional affliction being given to supplement
your already-rapid affliction delivery. Combining Nemesis and Scrag is
great for damage pressure, with both also providing excellent mana
draining capability if they're not careful. Rixil or Eerion make for a
good fourth, due to the further mana drain they provide (the latter
through frequent focussing). Cadmus has a similar boon, but is also good
when combining with a low-prio WhisperingMadness (not everyone will
prioritise it low, though so keep that in mind).

--[ Fighting ]--
----------------

Last but not least, the section that you're most likely wanting to know
about if you were referred to this guide. Occultist can be a great boon
to any group, regardless of their class make-up. It can drain mana
incredibly well, damage quite well and, thanks to new gifts, can even
provide a myriad of salve afflictions on top of the freezing they've
always had.

If you're not an overly durable, or capable fighter yet, it's strongly
suggested you learn how your doppleganger functions (AB DOMINATION
PIRIDON). This can be used to damage foes from afar, and fling tarot
cards without being in their room. Seek out an experienced Occultist to
learn how to effectively use this entity. Or find someone to practice on
in the arena.

Next up we have Tarot. There are very, very few cards you won't be using
frequently. Chariot (if you have no mount) and Wheel are about the only
ones, with Death, Creator and Emperor also only having niche use cases.

- Lust is great for splitting enemies off from their group, especially
when used with your doppleganger in conjunction with Empress. The latter
can be used to save allies, too.
- Universe and Hermit are great for mobility.
- Star tarot is a good complement for ranged damage whilst outdoors.
- Priestess/Magician/Fool are all good for keeping yourself (and others)
alive.
- Hangedman/Aeon are both great for keeping a foe in place. The latter
is especially useful after a target starbursts.
- Most others will be used to supplement afflictions as you see fit.
Ruinate particularly allows for devastating effects when used with the
Justice of Lovers cards. (the former for groups).

For fighting on your own (or with another teammate who afflicts well),
your end goal is almost always going to be Enlighten, followed by
Unravel. You achieve this through a combination of INSTILL as well as
smart utilisation of your Domination entities. The general method to
reaching this is to stack physical afflictions (asthma, healthleech, et
cetera) as well as the WhisperingMadness affliction, then use
Pyradius(firelord) to convert them all into mental afflictions, followed
by an immediate Enlighten. This'll stop any of those afflictions from
being cured, wherein you can immediately UNRAVEL their mind.

Another method is to use the aforementioned mana damage setup of
Primebonds, stick both asthma and manaleech (via RUINATE LOVERS), then
enervate their mana away. Once it is low enough (40%) you can use
CLEANSEAURA, followed by Glaaki's abomination to steal their truenames
(up to 3 maximum) which you can then use for a great burst of damage.

Beyond these methods, it is up to you to delve further into the complex
Occult arts. There are numerous in Ashtan well-versed who you can seek
out.
