(Academy of Ascension): Tkarius says, "I have been looking into the houses 
here in Ashtan. The decision between the three seems rather difficult as I'm 
not quite sure how the choice will affect me."
(Academy of Ascension): Archaeon says, "You face an issue. A demon stands in 
your path and will not let you pass."

Miraman 20th, 373 AF:

   
Cthul's beggings are nothing glamerous, they start in a swamp land whre
his parents escaped to from slavery. His parents where but tools for a
wizard, that treated them with the lowest respect. and this wizard did
all he could to dominate there lives. There entire relationship was a
secret to the wizard, and when Cthul's parent's showed signs of a
carrying a child they understood they had to flee in oreder to avoid the
wrath of this unnamed wizard. Cthul' life wasnt hard in the forest, for
his parents where very adapt to living there, just unfortunitly he
didn't pick up htere ways of survial. Cthul never even asked as to why
they lived out there and not within the protection and comfort of a
city. While he was 17 his parents told him why, and just like any
righteous being he felt that this wizard, whose name was never told to
Cthul, deserved to pay.

Now although he had the desire for revenge, he didnt really plan on
leaving his parents any time soon, untill the mournfull day the wizards
assain have finally caugt up with all of them. After trying to run from
the assain and a little bit of a fight, Cthul's parents where killed.
Cthul managed to get away and lose his would be killer.

Some days past by and to fearfull of retunring to his home he wandered
hopelessly around, barely able to find food or shelter. By chance of
luck he came across an adventurer who was willing to hlep him and tell
him about an Island that traines people in the was of adventruing. That
could lead one to greatness if followed dilengently enough. Cthul seeing
the oppertunity in this and went with his new friend to this Isle with
the dreams of revenge and conquest.

Before leaving the Isle he learned of a gulid that promotes freedom, and
the chance to gain power, that just so happen to lie within a powerful
city. The ideals he was tought about these... occultists intrigued him.
This here would be his chance to grasp power, and to use it to his will.
If he could rise in the ranks of this guild, and possibly the cities...
what could stop him from his goal. With his new found hope and
determination he will rise in ranks and power! He will let nothing stand
in his way.

There will be a day when Cthul will have a name for this wizard, and
when he has it, this enemy will pay for the crimes he has commited. So
will all of his friends and allies. Even if it means taking on entire
nations.


His search still continues...
