Interlink (Occultism)                         Known: Yes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:            BODYWARP <target> <limb> [lesser occultic work]
Details:
Through extensive study of the Unnamables, the Occultists of Ashtan have
determined how to mutate the bodies of others in a more controlled
manner than previously believed possible(*). This greater working builds
upon the lesser forms of warping, though requires a far greater degree
of finesse. However, it comes with the unique benefit that lesser
occultic workings(**) may be introduced into the process.

* Does limb damage and a minor amount of health damage. The limb damage is increased against a limb that is already broken to requiring a mending salve.
** Lesser works which can be combined are: ague, shrivel, and regress.

- use Hecate first to increase limb damage, difference is healthy limbe 14.7, vs shriveled 20

TRUENAMES will tell you whose truenames you have and how many times you may utter it. If the truename of a person is uttered in front of him or her, that person will be harmed in body and mind and be inflicted by the Aeon curse. Once uttered, that particular truename will be forgotten.

Due to the mental strain of remembering an individual's truename, you are only able to remember up to three for each person, for a total of fifty people.

Works on/against:  Adventurers
Cooldown:          4.00 seconds of equilibrium
Resource:          2% karma
Details:
Perhaps the cruelest curse imaginable, you can reveal the occult
mysteries to a non-initiate as you have learned it. Their minds must be
sufficiently open for the revelation to be received. In other words,
they must have six(*) of: claustrophobia, agoraphobia, lovers, dementia,
epilepsy, hallucinations, confusion, stupidity, paranoia, vertigo,
shyness, addiction, recklessness, or masochism.

If such is the case, you may give that target the revelation of what the
nature of the universe is as you see it, which will unfortunately make
their insanities permanent until death.

* This number drops to five if they are suffering from the curse of
whispering madness.

Slaying an individual in this manner will release a potent karmic aura, buffering your own karma.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:            COMPEL <target> <compulsion>
Works on/against:  Adventurers
Details:
The mysteries of the multiverse are many and great, but the fragile mind
of the unenlightened ever shies away from such possibility. Yet when you
have seized upon the fundamental nature of such a mortal derived from
their yet living person(*), you will find that more delicate
opportunities open up before you.

You may command such a student to observe one of these mysteries. If
they are adequately prepared for the revelation therein, various results
will be made manifest:

Discord:
Requires: the target have the healthleech and asthma afflictions.
Result: their mind will be greatly strained, causing them to be struck
down with the loneliness and dizziness afflictions.

Entropy:
Requires: the target has the haemophilia and addiction afflictions.
Result: the subject will contemplate the nature of time, losing the
speed defence if it is present and being struck down with the curse of
the Aeon if it is not.

Potential:
Requires: the target be afflicted with all four of their limbs being
broken or is frozen.
Result: if the target's limbs are broken, they will suffer a short-lived
blackout. If they are frozen, they will suffer damage.

* It must be a true name acquired via the Glaaki ability in Domination.
** Compelling carries its own internal cooldown, and though it requires
both balance and equilibrium, it consumes neither.

Cooldown:          Equilibrium
Resource:          Karma
Details:
Congratulations! Your studies have now reached the plateau wherein your
mastery of the occult is so great that you can now prepare your body and
aura for true transformation. Instead of dying, you will transmogrify
into a being of pure chaos--you will become a Chaos Lord. You will
receive one change of the body, skin, and a very odd miscellaneous
change
which correspond to the effects listed below. MUTATIONS will show you
exactly what the functions of the mutations you have are. It will not
show useless mutations (see below).

By raising a barrier between yourself and the Chaos Lord's spirit, you
may prevent your transformation from occurring upon death. This barrier
can be lowered in the future at a much smaller cost.

TRANSMOGRIFY STATUS will show the state of the Chaos Lord within your
soul, if any.

You may only use this ability once every 3-9 (random) Achaean days.

* Note: The chance for positive changes outweighs the chance for
negative changes by nearly a 2-1 margin. It is also possible to get a
useless mutation. For instance, bulging muscles that give no strength
advantage, or blotchy skin that does not subject you to greater magical
damage.
