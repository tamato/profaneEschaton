Block healing of limb by keeping Anorexia stuck

Possible ways to defeat someone
--------------------------------
Death Tarot

Enlighten
- could use this to test how they heal and what their priorities are.

Truename
- use glaaki's minions to get 3 truenames.
 - need to use cleanseaura ( mana must be < 40% )
  - lower mana (readaura .5 e) to check
   - Draining mana
    - enervate (4 e) if manaleech, then more.
        - runiated lovers == manaleech(smoke)
        - if frozen then more
        - if primed, Rixil drains. More if shivering and frozen
        - if primed, Nemesis (humbug) and need to be addicted
- utter truename (4 e)

You may command another entity to do your bidding.

You command your chimera to bring Satum low.
A chimera lets out a concussive roar at Satum.
Satum begins to pant in terror.
A look of extreme focus crosses the face of Satum.
